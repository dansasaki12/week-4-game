This game was built with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JQuery which utilizes Math.Random to randomize numbers for each crystal.

Crystal Collector:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game which shows up in the "Number to match:" field.  There are four crystals below and when you click them, they will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
To win the game, you need to match your total score to the random number that's generated.  If your total goes above the randon number, you lose.
The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it and will change each time the game loads.
